	<p> I studied psychology and economics at Wellesley College, with various work experience ranging from research at a risk management consulting firm to coding at a social cognition laboratory. Recently, I have begun to shift focus towards the high-risk, fast paced world of startups. <br /> I am in the Technical Marketing track at the Startup Institute Boston, and I love writing, researching, coding, and sifting through data.</p>
